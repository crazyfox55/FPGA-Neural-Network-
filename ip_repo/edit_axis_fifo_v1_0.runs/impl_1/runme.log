Resolution: Please specify clocks using create_clock/create_generated_clock for sequential elements. For pure combinatorial circuits, please specify a virtual clock, otherwise the vectorless estimation might be inaccurate
INFO: [Timing 38-35] Done setting XDC timing constraints.

Finished Running Vector-less Activity Propagation
WARNING: [Power 33-332] Found switching activity that implies high-fanout reset nets being asserted for excessive periods of time which may result in inaccurate power analysis.
Resolution: To review and fix problems, please run Power Constraints Advisor in the GUI from Tools > Power Constraints Advisor or run report_power with the -advisory option to generate a text report.
